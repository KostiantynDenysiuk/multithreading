The producer-consumer pattern is a common design pattern used in concurrent programming
to solve the problem of coordinating asynchronous production and consumption of data. In Java,

Key Concepts

Producer: A thread that produces data and puts it into a shared resource (e.g., a queue).
Consumer: A thread that consumes data from the shared resource.
Shared Resource: A thread-safe data structure that holds the produced data and from which
consumers retrieve the data.

Using BlockingQueue:
Java's java.util.concurrent package provides the BlockingQueue interface, which handles all
synchronization internally, making the implementation simpler and more robust.
